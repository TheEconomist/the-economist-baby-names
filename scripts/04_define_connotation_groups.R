# Next we define connotation groups. This was done through an LLM assisted process, where we iteratively fed the LLM the list of unassigned connotations and asked it if any belonged in any of these categories. Boundaries between concepts are subjective, and this is a limitation of this approach which ultimately relies in part on human judgement (is, for instance, "graceful" sufficiently related to beauty to belong to that category?)
